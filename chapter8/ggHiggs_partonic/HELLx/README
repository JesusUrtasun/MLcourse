HELL: High-Energy Large Logarithms - fast x-space version

Authors: Marco Bonvini



Provides high-energy resummed splitting functions and coefficient functions.
The fixed order counterparts have to be provided separately.
This code gives just the resummed part, minus the double counting with the appropriate fixed-order.
For the splitting functions, LL can be matched to LO and NLL to NLO only.
For the coefficient functions, which resum only when HELLx is loaded at NLL, it is possible to match both to NLO and NNLO.



Installation
----------------

Dependencies:  nothing in particular

To make the library and the examples, just type

> make -j

You might need to adjust the makefile first.
Then try to run
